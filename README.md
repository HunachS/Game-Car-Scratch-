# My Scratch Game
Creating a game for the first time on Scratch.

Goal of the game: Control the machine to collect as many coins as possible, avoiding collisions with machines.

How to play:

Click the green flag to start the game.
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control:
Up/Down: move vertically.
Left/Right: move horizontally between lanes.
Collect coins to increase your score, which is displayed in the upper right corner through sprites.
Avoid collisions with machines moving down the lanes.
The game ends if the machine collides with other machines - the inscription "Game Over" will appear.
